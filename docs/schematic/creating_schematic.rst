Creating a circuit schematic

The web system will be divided into two panes. The left pane will contain thumbnails of different electric components like capacitors, resistors, voltage sources, etc. each of which will be displayed category wise. The right pane will be a grid on which a user can drag and drop the components from the left pane. Each component will be associated with different properties like ‘x’ and ‘y’ denoting their position on the grid, ‘angle’ to denote their rotation angle (if rotated), etc. The wires will be used to connect different components on the grid (right pane).
