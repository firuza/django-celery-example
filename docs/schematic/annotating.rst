Assigning component values
**************************

Each component may or may not have unique properties. For example, a resistor will have a property to denote Volts (number). Each component on the grid needs to be annotated. The annotation convention will be a letter denoting the component followed by a number. The number ‘n’ will denote the nth component of that type on the grid. For example, R3, C1, G1, denotes the 3rd resistors, 1st capacitor, and 1st ground.
